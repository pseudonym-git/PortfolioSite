# G'day, this is where I'll be posting all the cool projects I complete

I have big plans for this one, including documenting:

- Setting up [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui) with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) so I can run and interact with Local LLMs directly on my laptop

- Creating this website using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio)

I'm currently working on an n8n automation which I'm planning will take inputs from a wide variety of sources, filter them with a local AI according to my interests and send me a summary of only the things I'm interested in.
