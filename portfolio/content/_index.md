# Hi, I'm a 1st-ish year student at Murdoch University ðŸ’»

Welcome to my portfolio website!

I have previously completed degrees in Criminology (Majoring in Criminal Behaviors) and Global Security (Majoring in Terrorism and Counterterrorism), and am now studying a 3rd bachelor degree, this time in IT (Majoring in Cybersecurity and Forensics). I am really interested in the intersections of these fields, where cybercrime funds terrorist activity, or where terrorist organizations and organized criminal organizations use IT and technology to enable their operations.


## Current Focus

Outside of uni, I'm interested in:
- Playing tennis
- Watching rugby
- Reading
- Carpentry
- Searching for ever more complex ways of doing simple things

## My Projects

Check out some of the homelab projects I've been working on in the [my_projects section](/my_projects/). 
Highlights include:

- Setting up [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui) with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) so I can run and interact with Local LLMs directly on my laptop

- Creating this website using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio)

I'm currently working on an n8n automation which I'm hoping will take inputs from a wide variety of sources, filter them with a local AI according to my interests and send me a summary of only the things I'm interested in.

## My Blog

If I ever come up with any ideas worth writing about, you'll be able to find it on my [blog](/blog/).
